			<p><strong>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</strong> by Marie Kondo</p>
			<p>Marie Kondo is a professional organizer. Her tidying philosophy is simple. She advocates to only keep what brings you joy. She advises against saving items for a rainy day with the hope that you or someone else may need them. If you haven't used it yet, you will never use it.</p>
			<p>Kondo was fascinated by home organiztion since she was a child. One day, she wondered why her home wasn't in order even though she kept up-to-date on all the popular tidying methods. She figured out that you can't be organized if you don't cut down on your possessions.</p>
			<p>I recommend this book because Kondo's advice can be applied to everyone's life. Thrifters (beginners and veterans) must keep her philosophy in mind and not get carried away with their treasure hunting. Kondo's technique is simple and her book is a quick read.</p>

			<p><strong>Coolirpa </strong></p>
			<p>This is my favorite Youtube channel for thrifting. In her series "Thrifted Transformations," April Yang makes new outfits from items she finds at secondhand stores. Some ensembles require a simple resizing. Others are truly unique creations.</p>
