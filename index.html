		<!--I decided to use the <p> tag to make my navigation. I didn't like making an unordered list and writing CSS code to remove the bullet. I didn't want to make my navigation fixed at the top of the screen because the this will cause the .nav items to overlap page content and it will require margin-top added to the .text div to compensate for this. To make up for a lack of a fixed navigation, I decided to make a "Back to Top" arrow button.-->

			<h1>Home</h1>
			<p>Welcome to <em>Thrifting in NYC: For Beginners</em>!</p>
			<p>I am introducing you to the wonderful world of thrift stores. It's very easy to find hidden gems, but you need to know where to look for them. <strong>Presently, this website will focus on clothes and non-profit stores in NYC</strong>.</p>
			<p>I provide a brief summary of thrifting resources. I encorage you to visit the stores and their websites for their current policies.</p>

			<!--Beginning of thrift store image. Centered in its div. I assigned this image its own class because this will be the only center-aligned image and all other website images will float to the right of text.-->

			<!--End of .thrift image.-->
			<!--I decided to use <figure> and <figcaption> tags for my images. I discovered these tags through W3 Schools. I put those tags within a div because I like the margin space that a div adds to <figure>. This is useful for images that have text wrapping around them. Without the div, I would have to add margin or padding to the image. Also, I like <figcaption> because it doesn't leave a space between image and caption like a <p> tag would. -->
