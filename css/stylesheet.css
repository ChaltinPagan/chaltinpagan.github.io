/*I added a background color to the <html> element so my margins will have a different color than the body. Doing this affected the margin color on the top and bottom of the webpage.

/*Originally, I used h1 and h2 for the header of the website and I made their font-size bigger. Cloud9 suggested these should not have a defined font-size and I should use the default setting. Since I wanted the font-size of the header to be larger than what h1 and h2 offered, I changed those to <p> in the HTML and used first-child and nth-child in the CSS. This worked the same. I kept the first-child and nth-child selectors because I wanted to show a better understanding of CSS. 
Also, I declared the font color in each .head p because I won't get the right result I want if I declare it in .head div.

/*I had red "test" borders around my divs when I started coding the website. When I removed the red border, a funny thing happened: The height of my navigation became smaller. When I inspected the .nav div and the <p> element, I saw there was top and bottom margin space of 18px for the div. For some reason, the margin space of the div filled with background color only when I had the border around the div. If I declared a height for my div, then the text would abut with the top of the div and I would have to add padding  space to center it vertically. For my solution, I decided for the "".nav p" to make the margin 0px and replace that with top and bottom padding. The padding will fill with background color. Now, my navigation height will appear the same with or without the red div border. I did this to the <p> element rather than the <a> element since my "a" element has a different background color on the hover and I don't want to increase the active link space.*/
